# Peer-to-Peer Federated Learning Simulator

### PeerFL : A Simulator for P2P FL at scale

Model training on Python (using Keras/TF)   
Network simulation using ns3   
Device constraints like available RAM, GPU applied   

Simulation1 : CIFAR dataset across 10 clients
Simulation 2 : Heterogenous data split and training across 200 clients
